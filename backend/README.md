# Web3 Application Architecture: Abstract Layers

## 1. Presentation Layer
- **Purpose**: Handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Components**: API routes, controllers, input validation, response formatting
- **Examples**: Express route handlers, middleware for authentication

## 2. Business Logic Layer
- **Purpose**: Implementing domain-specific rules and workflows
- **Components**: Services orchestrating operations, business rule validation
- **Examples**: ItemService, TransactionService with business logic

## 3. Data Access Layer
- **Purpose**: Abstracting data storage and retrieval operations
- **Components**: Direct model operations, queries, data transformations
- **Examples**: Mongoose model operations, data aggregation functions

## 4. Blockchain Integration Layer
- **Purpose**: Interfacing with blockchain networks
- **Components**: Provider setup, contract instances, event listeners
- **Examples**: Contract method calls, transaction building, event processing

## 5. Infrastructure Layer
- **Purpose**: Cross-cutting technical concerns
- **Components**: Logging, database connection, configuration
- **Examples**: MongoDB connection, logger setup, environment configuration

These abstract layers represent the logical separation of concerns in the application, regardless of how the files are physically organized in folders.
